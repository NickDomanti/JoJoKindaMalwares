# JoJo-kinda-malwares
A collection of my kinda-malwares related to JoJo villains. D4C IS NOT DONE! It does nothing actually.

TheWorld.exe stops the system clock for like 9 seconds (it also blocks your mouse cursor, it's a bit buggy when the program ends, couldn't think of a fix for that), KingCrimson.exe sets the clock at 10 seconds later, while MadeInHeaven speeds up the clock, like, a lot. The issue with last one is the UI, which is a laggy GIF and needs to be fixed.

You can find all the executables under the directory StandName/StandName/bin/Release/
